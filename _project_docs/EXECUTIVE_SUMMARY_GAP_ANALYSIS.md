## What's Missing (The Game OS Experience) ⏳

### Critical UI/UX Gaps (30% Missing)

The **gamification layer** is not visible to users:

1. **Strategic Deck Home Screen** ⏳
   - Current: Traditional home screens
   - Required: Locked/unlocked feature cards
   - **This is the #1 blocker**

2. **Aura Ring Integration** 🟡
   - Current: Aura dashboard exists but hidden
   - Required: Circular progress ring on home
   - Users can't see their level

3. **Daily Quests Card** 🟡
   - Current: 100+ quests exist but not surfaced
   - Required: 3 active quests on home screen
   - Users don't see goals

4. **Feature Unlock Enforcement** 🟡
   - Current: All features accessible
   - Required: Lock features by level
   - No progression gating

5. **Floating Opportunity Pill** 🟡
   - Current: Co-Pilot exists but no UI
   - Required: Context-aware suggestions
   - Opportunities not visible

---

## The Core Problem

**We built an excellent economic operating system, but it looks like a utility app.**

The Game OS philosophy requires:
- ✅ Backend systems (DONE)
- ⏳ Gamification UI (MISSING)

Users need to **see** and **feel** the game mechanics:
- Locked features they can unlock
- Progress bars showing advancement
- XP rewards for every action
- Quests guiding their journey
- Opportunities appearing contextually

**Right now, they just see a food delivery app with extra features.**
